This library is still in development. Please follow up this package during the following days to have a functional library...

This library can read and parse ionToF file format .ITA, .ITM and .ITS.

As ionToF uses a proprietary file format all the data parsing is done by pure trial and errors, so this library might by very buggy.

REQUIREMENTS
============

This library requires the library pySPM (https://github.com/scholi/pySPM) to be installed!
