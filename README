This library is still in development. Please follow up this package during the following days to have a functional library...

This library can read and parse ionToF file format .ITA, .ITM and .ITS.

For the moment is was tested with .ITA files and the channels data can be retrieved.

As ionToF uses a proprietary file format all the data parsing is done by pure trial and errors, so this library might by very buggy.
